abstract = {Standing is a fundamental skill mastered by humans and animals alike. Although easy for adults, it requires careful and deliberate manipulation of contact forces. The variation in contact configuration (e.g., standing on one foot, on uneven ground, or while holding on for support) presents a difficult challenge for interactive simulation of humans and animals, especially while performing tasks in the presence of external disturbances. We describe an analytic approach for control of standing in three-dimensional simulations based upon local optimization. At any point in time, the control system solves a quadratic program to compute actuation by maximizing the performance of multiple motion objectives subject to constraints imposed by actuation limits and contact configuration. This formulation is suitable for interactive animation and it adapts to the proportions of any character model in any non-planar, frictional contact configuration.},

The key design aspects of the integrated joint, like the motor's armature, cooling system, motor housing, bearing arrangement, sensors, and power electronics are detailed. We also present a number of advanced implementations in motor torque control, optimal joint torque sensory feedback, and motion control using positive joint torque feedback. Experimental results illustrate an outstanding performance regarding thermal response, torque ripple, reference trajectory tracking, torque disturbance rejection, and joint stiffness.},

Optimization is performed using a small set of simple goals, e.g., one hand should be on the ground or the center-of-mass should be above a particular height. These objectives are applied to short spacetime windows which can be composed to express goals over an entire animation. Specific contact locations needed to achieve objectives are not required by our method. We show that the method can synthesize many different kinds of movement, including walking, hand walking, breakdancing, flips, and crawling. Most of these movements have never been previously synthesized by physics-based methods.},

A new controller structure is proposed, which consists of an impedance controller enhanced by local stiffness control. This structure consistently takes into account the two time scale property of the joint and Cartesian control loops. The DLR light-weight robot, with its position, torque and impedance interfaces on joint level, is an adequate platform for the implementation of the presented methods. The experimental results are discussed and a critical comparison of the performance with different controllers is made. As an application for the new control structure the fast and intuitive teaching of an insertion task (piston into a motor block) is described.},

Herein the recent DLR results on torque-, position-, as well as impedance control of flexible joint robots are summarized, and the relations between the individual contributions are highlighted. It is shown that an inner torque feedback loop can be incorporated into a passivity based analysis by interpreting torque feedback in terms of shaping of the motor inertia. This result, which implicitly was already included in our earlier works on torque- and position control, can also be seized for the design of impedance controllers. For impedance control, furthermore, potential shaping is of special interest. It is shown how, based only on the motor angles, a potential function can be designed which simultaneously incorporates gravity compensation and a desired Cartesian stiffness relation for the link angles.},

@article{Aswani2013,
abstract = {Controller design faces a trade-off between robustness and performance, and the reliability of linear controllers has caused many practitioners to focus on the former. However, there is renewed interest in improving system performance to deal with growing energy constraints. This paper describes a learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) scheme that provides deterministic guarantees on robustness, while statistical identification tools are used to identify richer models of the system in order to improve performance; the benefits of this framework are that it handles state and input constraints, optimizes system performance with respect to a cost function, and can be designed to use a wide variety of parametric or nonparametric statistical tools. The main insight of LBMPC is that safety and performance can be decoupled under reasonable conditions in an optimization framework by maintaining two models of the system. The first is an approximate model with bounds on its uncertainty, and the second model is updated by statistical methods. LBMPC improves performance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learned dynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these same inputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPC control action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using the true dynamics. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

When the condition number of the foot grows beyond normal values we command the foot to step back within the reachable workspace to gain stability.

We propose a task space CPG-based trajectory generation that can be modulated according to terrain irregularities and the posture of the robot trunk. To improve the robot's stability, we implemented a null space based attitude control for the trunk and a push recovery algorithm based on the concept of capture points. Simulations and experimental results on the hydraulically actuated quadruped robot HyQ will be presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.},

abstract = {This paper proposes to decouple performance optimization and enforcement of asymptotic convergence in Model Predictive Control (MPC) so that convergence to a given terminal set is achieved independently of how much performance is optimized at each sampling step. By embedding an explicit decreasing condition in the MPC constraints and thanks to a novel and very easy-to-implement convex feasibility solver proposed in the paper, it is possible to run an outer performance optimization algorithm on top of the feasibility solver and optimize for an amount of time that depends on the available CPU resources within the current sampling step (possibly going open-loop at a given sampling step in the extreme case no resources are available) and still guarantee convergence to the terminal set. While the MPC setup and the solver proposed in the paper can deal with quite general classes of functions, we highlight the synthesis method and show numerical results in case of linear MPC and ellipsoidal and polyhedral terminal sets.},

The main limitation of MPC is, however, its online computational complexity. For discrete-time linear time-invariant systems with constraints on inputs and states, we develop an algorithm to determine explicitly the state feedback control law associated with MPC, and show that it is piecewise linear and continuous. The controller inherits all the stability and performance properties of MPC, but the online computation is reduced to a simple linear function evaluation instead of the expensive quadratic program. The new technique is expected to enlarge the scope of applicability of MPC to small-size/fast-sampling applications which cannot be covered satisfactorily with anti-windup schemes},

Then the problem is solved by designing a regulator, based on the variable structure control, able to steer the state vector to the origin in minimum time, being compliant with all the constraints. With this purpose, a modular structure with a cascade of controllers, each one devoted to the regulation to the origin of a speciﬁc component of the state vector, is demonstrated to be effective and ideally suitable to cope with systems of any order.

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of planning the motion of a multi-limbed robot in order to “free-climb ” vertical rock surfaces. Free-climbing only relies on frictional contact with the surfaces rather than on special fixtures or tools like pitons. It requires strength, but more importantly it requires deliberate reasoning: not only must the robot decide how to adjust its posture to reach the next feature without falling, it must plan an entire sequence of steps, where each one might have future consequences. In this paper, this process of reasoning is broken into manageable pieces by decomposing a free-climbing robot's configuration space into manifolds associated with each state of contact between the robot and its environment. A multi-step planning framework is presented that decides which manifolds to explore by generating a candidate sequence of hand and foot placements first. A one-step planning algorithm is then described that explores individual manifolds quickly. This algorithm extends the probabilistic roadmap approach to better handle the interaction between static equilibrium and the topology of closed kinematic chains. It is assumed throughout this paper that a set of potential contact points has been presurveyed. Validation with real hardware was done with a four-limbed robot called lemur (developed by the Mechanical and Robotic Technologies Group at nasa-jpl). Using the planner presented in this paper, lemur free-climbed an indoor, near-vertical surface covered with artificial rock features. 1},

abstract = {Consider a legged robot at fixed foot placements. Where can the robot move its center of mass (CM) while remaining in static equilibrium? If the terrain is flat, the CM must lie above the convex hull of the robot's feet. If the terrain is not flat, this often-used approximation can be arbitrarily bad. Instead, the CM must lie above the projection of a nonlinear convex set that is defined by the properties of each foot placement. This paper presents an algorithm to compute the shape of this projection and gives a tight bound on the algorithm's running time. It also presents a method of amortizing the cost of this computation when it is only necessary to test static equilibrium at particular CM positions--that is, when it is only necessary to test the membership of points in the projection of a convex set rather than find its shape.},

abstract = {A legged robot walking on uneven terrain can avoid falling only by applying contact forces with its feet on the ground that compensate for gravity without causing slip. To plan safe motions, it is necessary to test this constraint at every posture explored at each set of foot placements. Since a huge number of postures may be explored, this test must be as fast as possible. Existing approaches either search explicitly for contact forces at each posture, or precompute the support polygon and check that the robot's center of mass lies above it. This paper presents a new algorithm that is faster than either existing approach. This algorithm is an incremental method of projection, that computes only enough of the support polygon to decide whether static equilibrium is possible at each posture. It takes advantage of information gained testing previous postures in order to test subsequent postures more quickly},

abstract = {This paper develops an approach for driver-aware vehicle control based on stochastic model predictive control with learning (SMPCL). The framework combines the on-board learning of a Markov chain that represents the driver behavior, a scenario-based approach for stochastic optimization, and quadratic programming. By using quadratic programming, SMPCL can handle, in general, larger state dimension models than stochastic dynamic programming, and can reconfigure in real-time for accommodating changes in driver behavior. The SMPCL approach is demonstrated in the energy management of a series hybrid electrical vehicle, aimed at improving fuel efficiency while enforcing constraints on battery state of charge and power. The SMPCL controller allocates the power from the battery and the engine to meet the driver power request. A Markov chain that models the power request dynamics is learned in real-time to improve the prediction capabilities of model predictive control (MPC). Because of exploiting the learned pattern of the driver behavior, the proposed approach outperforms conventional model predictive control and shows performance close to MPC with full knowledge of future driver power request in standard and real-world driving cycles.},

Although the force feedback has been widely used to control the interaction with objects (e.g., object grasping andmanipulation), the use of tactile data inmore complex inter- action tasks did not receive a comparable attention. The lack of an available skin-like technology has limited the development of tactile based control strategies. The major contribution of this paper is to describe a control strategy controlling the interaction task of a robot arm, equipped with tactile sensors, in contact with an external object or human through the somatosensory map.

sampled measurements is addressed. The measurements may be corrupted by
colored noise. A key idea is to use stochastic models of the signal to
be differentiated and of the measurement noise. Two approaches are
suggested. The first is based on a continuous-time stochastic process as
a model of the signal. The second uses a discrete-time ARMA model of the
signal and a discrete-time approximation of the derivative operator.
Digital differentiators are presented in a shift operator polynomial
form. They minimize the mean-square estimation error, and are calculated
from a linear polynomial equation and a polynomial spectral
factorization. The three obstacles to perfect differentiation, namely a
finite smoothing lag, measurement noise, and aliasing effects due to
sampling, are discussed},

abstract = {We propose a method for checking and enforcing multi-contact stability based on the zero-moment point (ZMP). Our first contribution is to characterize and provide a fast computation algorithm for ZMP support areas in arbitrary virtual planes. Contrary to previous works, our support areas also account for frictional constraints. We then select a ZMP plane above the center of mass of the robot, which turns the usual (unstable) control law of a linear inverted pendulum into that of a (marginally stable) linear pendulum (LP). We next observe that pendular models involve a regulation of the dynamic momentum, which in turn shrinks the support area of the ZMP. Our second contribution is a new algorithm to compute ZMP support areas under both frictional and dynamic-momentum constraints. We show that, under an LP control law, the support areas thus constructed are a necessary and sufficient condition for contact stability. Based on these developments, we implement a whole-body controller and generate dynamically-stable motions where an HRP-4 humanoid locomotes in challenging simulation environments.},

abstract = {The planning problem for a mobile manipulator system that must perform
a sequence of tasks defined by position, orientation, force, and
moment vectors at the end-effector is considered. Each task can be
performed in multiple configurations due to the redundancy introduced
by mobility. The planning problem is formulated as an optimization
problem in which the decision variables for mobility (base position)
are separated from the manipulator joint angles in the cost function.
The resulting numerical problem is nonlinear with nonconvex, unconnected
feasible regions in the decision space. Simulated annealing is proposed
as a general solution method for obtaining near-optimal results.
The problem formulation and numerical solution by simulated annealing
are illustrated for a manipulator system with three degrees of freedom
mounted on a base with two degrees of freedom. The results are compared
with results obtained by conventional nonlinear programming techniques
customized for the particular example system.},

Although such a behavior is quite natural for humans, it is very difficult to find the best formulation to adapt human motion to humanoid robots. This paper proposes a conceptually simple framework of human posture control based on optimization which takes into account grasp and friction and achieves robustness against external disturbances. A new stability criteria is also introduced. Contrary to most other approaches, our method deals not only with unilateral contacts with friction but also with bilateral grasps. This allows for arbitrarily pulling, pushing or twisting on a handhold. Additionally, and in contrast to classical methods based on ZMP, our method also accounts for contacts not being all in the same plane.},

THe variables are CoM position and contact wrenches. However their formulation is not proper because they first compute the contact wrenches corresponding to the disturbance-wrench directions using a pseudo-inverse and then they find the max disturbance-wrench amplitude that doesn't violate the inequalities.},

 These algorithms rely on a collision-checking module, providing information about the feasibility of candidate trajectories, and connect a set of points sampled from the obstacle-free space in order to build a graph (roadmap) of feasible trajectories. Theroadmap is then used to construct the solution to the original
motion-planning problem.

Optimal Motion Planning

        
The quality of the solutions computed by a motion planning algorithm is always important.

        

        
one may be interested in solution paths of minimum cost,
with respect to a given cost functional, such as the length
of a path, or the time required to execute it. The problem of
computing optimal motion plans has been proven by Canny
and Reif (1987) to be very challenging even in basic cases

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
The standard PRM and RRT algorithms are not asymptotically optimal, and that the ‘simplified' PRM algorithm is asymptotically opti-mal, but computationally expensive. 

        
Moreover, it is shown that the k-nearest variant of the (simplified) PRM algorithm is not necessarily probabilistically complete (e.g. it
is not probabilistically complete for k = 1), and is not
asymptotically optimal for any fixed k.

        
 PRM∗ , RRG, and RRT∗  and proven to be probabilistically complete, asymptotically optimal, and computationally efficient. Of these, PRM∗ isa batch variable-radius PRM, applicable to multiple-query
problems, in which the radius is scaled with the number
of samples in a way that provably ensures both asymp-
totic optimality and computational efficiency. RRG is an
incremental algorithm that builds a connected roadmap,
providing similar performance to PRM∗ in a single-query
setting, and in an anytime fashion (i.e. a first solution
is provided quickly, and monotonically improved if more
computation time is available). The RRT∗ algorithm is
a variant of RRG that incrementally builds a tree, pro-
viding anytime solutions, provably converging to an opti-
mal solution, with minimal computational and memory
requirements.

The idea is to handle a collision at a generic point along the robot as a fault of its actuating system. A previously developed dynamic FDI (fault detection and isolation) technique is used, which does not require acceleration or force measurements. The actual robot link that has collided can also be identified. Once contact has been detected, it is possible to switch to a suitably defined hybrid force/motion controller that enables to keep the contact, while sliding on the obstacle, and to regulate the interaction force. Simulation results are shown for a two-link planar robot.},

We present two real-time DCM trajectory generators for uneven (three-dimensional) ground surfaces, which lead to continuous leg (and corresponding ground reaction) force profiles and facilitate the use of toe-off motion during double support. Thus, the resulting DCM trajectories are well suited for real-world robots and allow for increased step length and height. The performance of the proposed methods was tested in numerous simulations and experiments on IHMC's Atlas robot and DLR's humanoid robot TORO.},

In particular, we introduce a method to intuitively derive a CP reference trajectory from the next three steps and extend the linear inverted pendulum (LIP) based CP tracking controller introduced in [1], generalizing it to a model that contains vertical CoM motions and changes in angular momentum. Respecting the dynamics of general multibody systems, we propose a measurement-based compensation of multi-body effects, which leads to a stable closed-loop dynamics of bipedal walking robots. In addition we propose a ZMP projection method, which prevents the robots feet from tilting and ensures the best feasible CP tracking. The extended CP controller's performance is validated in OpenHRP3 [2] simulations and compared to the controller proposed in [1].},

Based on eCMP, VRP and DCM, we present a method for real-time planning and control of DCM trajectories in 3D.

Re- cently LCPs are being deployed for other types of animation like deformable models, fluids, and granular material. Thus, LCPs are becoming a general important fundamental model. Hence, there is a real need for providing the numerical foundation for solving LCPs with numerical methods that are suitable for computer graphics. This is the void that these course notes tries to fill out – providing a toolbox of solutions for people in physics-based animation. The contribution of these notes is twofold. First, we explain the nature of LCPs and discuss the properties of the LCPs encountered in physics-based animation. Second, we present a range of numerical meth- ods for solving the LCPs. To help make our results available to others we supplement our course notes with Matlab implementations of all iterative methods discussed. Keywords:},

abstract = {In order to meet tight emission limits Diesel engines are nowadays equipped with additional hardware components like an exhaust gas recirculation valve and a variable geometry turbocharger. Conventional engine control units use two SISO control loops to regulate the exhaust gas recirculation valve and the variable geometry turbocharger, although their effects are highly coupled. Moreover, these actuators are subject to physical constraints which seems to make an advanced control approach like model predictive control (MPC) the method of choice. In order to deal with MPC sampling times in the order of milliseconds, we employed an extension of the recently developed online active set strategy for controlling a real-world Diesel engine in a closed-loop manner. The results show that predictive engine control based on online optimisation can be accomplished in real-time - even on cheap controller hardware - and leads to increased controller performance. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Fogassi1996,
abstract = {1. We studied the functional properties of neurons in the caudal part of inferior area 6 (area F4) in awake monkeys. In agreement with previous reports, we found that the large majority (87{\{}{\%}{\}}) of neurons responded to sensory stimuli. The responsive neurons fell into three categories: somatosensory neurons (30{\{}{\%}{\}}); visual neurons (14{\{}{\%}{\}}); and bimodal, visual and somatosensory neurons (56{\{}{\%}{\}}). Both somatosensory and bimodal neurons typically responded to light touch of the skin. Their RFs were located on the face, neck, trunk, and arms. Approaching objects were the most effective visual stimuli. Visual RFs were mostly located in the space near the monkey (peripersonal space). Typically they extended in the space adjacent to the tactile RFs. 2. The coordinate system in which visual RFs were coded was studied in 110 neurons. In 94 neurons the RF location was independent of eye position, remaining in the same position in the peripersonal space regardless of eye deviation. The RF location with respect to the monkey was not modified by changing monkey position in the recording room. In 10 neurons the RF's location followed the eye movements, remaining in the same retinal position (retinocentric RFs). For the remaining six neurons the RF organization was not clear. We will refer to F4 neurons with RF independent of eye position as somatocentered neurons. 3. In most somatocentered neurons (43 of 60 neurons) the background level of activity and the response to visual stimuli were not modified by changes in eye position, whereas they were modulated in the remaining 17. It is important to note that eye deviations were constantly accompanied by a synergic increase of the activity of the ipsilateral neck muscles. It is not clear, therefore, whether the modulation of neuron discharge depended on eye position or was a consequence of changes in neck muscle activity. 4. The effect of stimulus velocity (20-80 cm/s) on neuron response intensity and RF extent in depth was studied in 34 somatocentered neurons. The results showed that in most neurons the increase of stimulus velocity produced an expansion in depth of the RF. 5. We conclude that space is coded differently in areas that control somatic and eye movements. We suggest that space coding in different cortical areas depends on the computational necessity of the effectors they control.},

Previous work by the authors has demonstrated the effectiveness of CLF controllers for stabilizing periodic gaits for biped walkers, and the current work expands on those results by providing a more effective means for handling control saturations. The new approach, based on a convex optimization routine running at a 1 kHz control update rate, is useful not only for handling torque saturations but also for incorporating a whole family of user-defined constraints into the online computation of a CLF controller. The paper concludes with an experimental implementation of the main results on the bipedal robot MABEL.},

abstract = {The dynamics of each link and joint of a robot is characterized by a set of 14 standard dynamic parameters (6 for the inertia matrix, 3 for the centre of mass coordinates, 1 for the mass and 4 for the drive chain inertia and friction). It is known that only a subset of the standard parameters, called the base parameters, are identifiable using the inverse dynamic model and the linear least squares techniques. Moreover, some of the base parameters are poorly identified because they poorly affect the joint torque. Thus they can be eliminated, leading to a new subset of dynamic parameters called the essential parameters. However, the identified values of the base or the essential parameters may be physically inconsistent regarding to the loss of the positive definiteness of the robot inertia matrix. Several methods have been developed in the past to verify the physical consistency of the identified parameters but they are complicated, time consuming and lead to non-optimal parameters. To overcome these drawbacks, a new method calculates a set of optimal standard dynamic parameters which are the closest to a priori consistent dynamic parameters obtained through CAD data given by the robot manufacturers. This is a straightforward method which is based on using the SVD and the Cholesky factorization and the linear least squares techniques. The new procedure is experimentally validated on an industrial 6 degrees of freedom Stäubli TX-40 robot.},

abstract = {Off-line robot dynamic identification methods are mostly based on the use of the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model (IDIM), which calculates the joint force/torque that is linear in relation to the dynamic parameters, and on the use of linear least squares technique to calculate the parameters (IDIM-LS technique). The joint forces/torques are calculated as the product of the known control signal (the current reference) by the joint drive gains. Then it is essential to get accurate values of joint drive gains to get accurate identification of inertial parameters. In this paper it is proposed a new method for the identification of the total joint drive gains in one step, using available joint sampled data given by the standard controller of the moving robot and using CAD or measured values of the inertial parameters of a known payload. A new inverse dynamic model calculates the current reference signal of each joint j that is linear in relation to the dynamic parameters of the robot, to the inertial parameters of a known payload fixed to the end-effector, and to the inverse of the joint j drive gain. This model is calculated with current reference and position sampled data while the robot is tracking one reference trajectory without load on the robot and one trajectory with the known payload fixed on the robot. Each joint j drive gain is calculated independently by the weighted LS solution of an over-determined linear systems obtained with the equations of the joint j. The method is experimentally validated on an industrial St{\{}{\&}{\}}{\{}{\#}{\}}x00E4;ubli RX-90 robot.},

Its implementation utilizes the Cholesky and QR factorizations and procedures for updating them. The performance of the dual algorithm is compared against that of primal algorithms when nsed to solve randomly generated test problems and quadratic programs generated in the course of solving nonlinear programming problems by a successive quadratic programming code (the principal motivation for the development of the algorithm). These computational results indicate that the dual algorithm is superior to primal algorithms when a primal feasible point is not readily available. The algorithm is also compared theoretically to the modified-simplex type dual methods of Lemke and Van de Panne and Whinston and it is ilh,strated by a numerical example.},

abstract = {Several studies have shown that adults integrate visual and haptic information (and information from other modalities) in a statistically optimal fashion, weighting each sense according to its reliability [1, 2]. When does this capacity for crossmodal integration develop? Here, we show that prior to 8 years of age, integration of visual and haptic spatial information is far from optimal, with either vision or touch dominating totally, even in conditions in which the dominant sense is far less precise than the other (assessed by discrimination thresholds). For size discrimination, haptic information dominates in determining both perceived size and discrimination thresholds, whereas for orientation discrimination, vision dominates. By 8-10 years, the integration becomes statistically optimal, like adults. We suggest that during development, perceptual systems require constant recalibration, for which cross-sensory comparison is important. Using one sense to calibrate the other precludes useful combination of the two sources.},

abstract = {A long-standing question, going back at least 300 years to Berkeley's famous essay, is how sensory systems become calibrated with physical reality. We recently showed [1] that children younger than 8-10 years do not integrate visual and haptic information optimally, but that one or the other sense prevails: touch for size and vision for orientation discrimination. The sensory dominance may reflect crossmodal calibration of vision and touch, where the more accurate sense calibrates the other. This hypothesis leads to a clear prediction: that lack of clear vision at an early age should affect calibration of haptic orientation discrimination. We therefore measured size and orientation haptic discrimination thresholds in 17 congenitally visually impaired children (aged 5-19). Haptic orientation thresholds were greatly impaired compared with age-matched controls, whereas haptic size thresholds were at least as good, and often better. One child with a late-acquired visual impairment stood out with excellent orientation discrimination. The results provide strong support for our crossmodal calibration hypothesis.},

abstract = {In order to engage in useful activities, upright legged creatures must be able to maintain balance. Despite recent advances, the understanding, prediction and control of biped balance in realistic dynamical situations remain an unsolved problem and the subject of much research in robotics and biomechanics. Here we study the fundamental mechanics of the rotational stability of multi-body systems with the goal of identifying a general stability criterion. Our research focuses on H{\{}{\textless}{\}}sub{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}G{\{}{\textless}{\}}/sub{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}, the rate of change of centroidal angular momentum of a robot, as the physical quantity containing its stability information. We propose three control strategies using H{\{}{\textless}{\}}sub{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}G{\{}{\textless}{\}}/sub{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} that can be used for stability recapture of biped robots. For free walk on horizontal ground, a derived criterion refers to a point on the foot/ground surface of a robot where the total ground reaction force would have to act such that H{\{}{\textless}{\}}sub{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}G{\{}{\textless}{\}}/sub{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}=0. This new criterion generalizes earlier concepts such as GCoM, CoP, ZMP, and FRI point, and extends their applicability.},

abstract = {A central problem in motor control, in the representation of space, and in the perception of body schema is how the brain encodes the relative positions of body parts. According to psychophysical studies, this sense of limb position depends heavily on vision. However, almost nothing is currently known about how the brain uses vision to determine or represent the location of the arm or any other body part. The present experiment shows that the position of the arm is represented in the premotor cortex of the monkey (Macaca fascicularis) brain by means of a convergence of visual cues and proprioceptive cues onto the same neurons. These neurons respond to the felt position of the arm when the arm is covered from view. They also respond in a similar fashion to the seen position of a false arm.},

The same neurons also responded to the position of a visible, realistic false arm. The neurons were not sensitive to the sight of unrealistic substitutes for the arm and were able to distinguish a right from a left arm. These neurons appear to combine visual and somatosensory signals in order to monitor the configuration of the limbs.

abstract = { This paper shows some preliminary results on the dynamical balance of a humanoid robot grasping an environment. By grasping an environment, it becomes easier for the robot to keep balance. By using the linear programming, a necessary condition for keeping balance of the robot is formulated taking the grasping force into consideration. We show that the occasion exists where the stronger the hand of a humanoid robot grasps the handrail, the larger the region of ZMP for keeping balance becomes. We further show an experimental result of a humanoid robot climbing up a big gap increasing the stability by grasping a handrail.},

abstract = { This paper newly considers the ZMP (zero moment point) of a humanoid robot under arm/leg coordination. By considering the infinitesimal displacement and the moment acting on the convex hull of the supporting points, we show that our method for determining the region of ZMP can be applicable to several cases of the arm/leg coordination tasks. We first express two kinds of ZMPs for such coordination tasks, i.e., the conventional ZMP, and the "generalized zero moment point (GZMP)" which is a generalization of the ZMP to the arm/leg coordination tasks. By projecting the edges of the convex hull of the supporting points onto the floor, we show that the position and the region of the GZMP for keeping the dynamical balance can be uniquely obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by simulation results.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for generating dynamically feasible, keyframe-interpolating motions for robots undergoing contact, such as in legged locomotion and manipulation. The first stage generates a twice-differentiable interpolating path that obeys kinematic contact constraints up to a user-specified tolerance. The second stage optimizes speeds along the path to minimize time while satisfying dynamic constraints. The method supports velocity, acceleration, and torque constraints, and polyhedral contact friction constraints at an arbitrary number of contact points. The method is numerically stable, and empirical running time is weakly linear in the number of degrees of freedom and polynomial in the time-domain grid resolution. Experiments demonstrate that full-body motions for robots with 100 degrees of freedom and dozens of contact points are calculated in seconds.},

abstract = {— Hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) has emerged as a popular framework for dynamic and underactuated bipedal walking, but has significant implementation difficulties when applied to the high degrees of freedom present in humanoid robots. The primary impediment is the process of gait design– it is difficult for optimizers to converge on a viable set of virtual constraints defining a gait. This paper presents a methodology that allows for the fast and reliable generation of efficient multi-contact robotic walking gaits through the framework of HZD, even in the presence of underactuation. To achieve this goal, we unify methods from trajectory optimization with the control framework of multi-domain hybrid zero dynamics. By formulating a novel optimization problem in the context of direct collocation and generating analytic Jacobians for the constraints, solving the resulting nonlinear program becomes tractable for large-scale nonlinear programming solvers, even for systems as high-dimensional as humanoid robots. We experimentally validated our methodology on the spring-legged prototype humanoid, DURUS, showing that the optimization approach yields dynamic and stable 3D walking gaits.},

They have important theoretical benefits but have never been implemented on a torque controlled robot where model inaccuracies and real-time computation requirements can be problematic. In this contribution we present experimental results for the control of the lower body of a humanoid robot using these algorithms. We propose a simplification of the optimization problem that allows us to decrease computation time enough to implement it in a fast torque control loop. Experiments demonstrate the applicability of the approach. In a first experiment, we implement a momentum-based balance controller which shows robust performance in face of unknown disturbances. In a second experiment, a tracking task is evaluated to demonstrate the performance of the controller with more complicated hierarchies. Our results show that hierarchical inverse dynamics controllers can be efficiently used for feedback control of humanoid robots and that momentum-based balance control can be efficiently implemented on a real robot.},

We believe that our algorithm is as good or better than previously published algorithms in most situations, and dis- tinctly advantageous when feature extraction is a serious impediment. It combines computational efficiency with robustness against noisy data. It has been tested with two kinds of data.
1.The algorithm matches a two-dimensional image, in the form of a set of points, to a line segment model. It estimates a positive congruence (i.e., a translation plus a rotation) that moves the image onto the model. The algorithm is most appropriate for matching when the required congruence is small, and it seems very well suited to motion-tracking. However, good convergence has also been achieved for large congruences. The algorithm is robust against noise, and can deal with images that have both missing and extraneous points. Asymptotically, the computational complexity of the algorithm is O(NM) where N is the number of image points and M is the number of model segments. This compares favorably with other matching techniques.
Experimental results have been obtained for two kinds of images:
(1) points obtained from an optical range finder, and (2) edge points extracted from an intensity image. Only the former results are included, for lack of space.},

@inproceedings{407542,
abstract = {Many future applications of robotic systems will require that manipulators
perform operations while being carried by moving vehicles. However,
such a vehicle mounted mobile manipulator can be unstable or even
tip over. Previous work on stability control hardly considered the
dynamics and environmental disturbances. The stability of a mobile
manipulator has a close relation with the vehicle motion, manipulator
motion and posture, and end-effector force. To evaluate the stability
for a mobile manipulator, the concepts about stability, such as the
stability degree and the valid stable region based on the zero moment
point (ZMP) criterion have already been proposed. In this paper,
as a control scheme for maintaining or recovering stability, the
method of ZMP path planning by a stability potential field is presented,
in which the concepts of the goal state and prohibitive state of
stability are outlined. A motion planning algorithm is then formulated,
which controls the manipulator in order to maintain the stability
of the whole system while the vehicle is moving along a given trajectory},

abstract = {We propose to investigate the foundations of communication and symbolic behavior by means or a robotics approach, i.e. by studying how these behaviors might emerge from the physical dynamics of an agent and its sensory-motor interactions with the real world. In this perspective, the human-robot interface problem can be viewed as one of coupling the interaction dynamics of all agents. Through a number of case studies we will show that within this interaction dynamics there is sparse global structure, i.e. a structure that can be characterized by only a small number of points in phase space, and that it is best to interact with the agent, i.e. interfere with its dynamics, at these points. We introduce a humanoid robot with the capability for dynamic full-body movement. The preliminary results of two experiments, sitting and standing up, are presented. Lastly, experiments with self exploratory learning of embodiment and visual motor learning of neonatal imitation abilities are introduced.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a reactive leg motion generation method which integrates geometric constraints into its generation process. In order to react given instructions instantaneously or to keep balance against external disturbances, feasible steps must be generated automatically in real-time for safety. In many cases this feasibility has been realized by using predefined steps or admissible stepping regions. However, these predefinitions are often too conservative or valid only in limited situations. The proposed method considers geometric constraints in addition to joint limits during its generation process and it can utilize the ability of the robot to a maximum extent. It can generate feasible walking pattern in real-time by modifying the swing leg motion and the next landing position at each control cycle. The proposed method is validated by experiments using a humanoid robot HRP-2.},

necessitates to prioritize the task to secure the most critical ones. 

        
Tasks may be linear or non-linear in nature. Linear constraints includes Velocity and Acceleration limits in joints. Inequality constraints includes joint limits, visibility constraint, collision avoidance and signularities avoidance. Due to critical nature of unilateral constraints, they are  taken into account prior to solving any other tasks in most of the implementations. 

        
The contribution of this work will allow to prioritize both linear and non linear  equations in any order and generic enough to be applied to all problems of such nature.

This allows us to construct a novel algorithm for accurate frictional contact resolution based on a simple staggered sequence of projections. The algorithm accelerates performance using warm starts to leverage the potentially high temporal coherence between contact states and provides users with direct control over frictional accuracy. Applying this algorithm to rigid and deformable systems, we obtain robust and accurate simulations of frictional contact behavior not previously possible, at rates suitable for interactive haptic simulations, as well as large-scale animations. By construction, the proposed algorithm guarantees exact, velocity-level contact constraint enforcement and obtains long-term stable and robust integration. Examples are given to illustrate the performance, plausibility and accuracy of the obtained solutions.},

The friction force is modeled using a single-state dynamic model that is utilized in the friction compensation algorithm. A new method for identifying the parameters of the aforementioned model in a robotic manipulator is presented. To evaluate the performance of this method, two different manipulators with different friction characteristics are examined. A 2-DOF manipulator that is used for high-speed micrometer precision manipulation and a 4-DOF macromanipulator that is used for long-reach positioning tasks are considered. It is shown that despite the different nature of the two manipulators, the same method can effectively improve the speed, accuracy, and smoothness of the manipulation in both cases.},

abstract = {The synthesis of human motion is a complex procedure that involves accurate reconstruction of movement sequences, modeling of musculoskeletal kinematics, dynamics and actuation, and characterization of reliable performance criteria. Many of these processes have much in common with the problems found in robotics research. Task-based methods used in robotics may be leveraged to provide novel musculoskeletal modeling methods and physiologically accurate performance predictions. In this paper, we present (i) a new method for the real-time reconstruction of human motion trajectories using direct marker tracking, (ii) a task-driven muscular effort minimization criterion and (iii) new human performance metrics for dynamic characterization of athletic skills. Dynamic motion reconstruction is achieved through the control of a simulated human model to follow the captured marker trajectories in real-time. The operational space control and real-time simulation provide human dynamics at any configuration of the performance. A new criteria of muscular effort minimization has been introduced to analyze human static postures. Extensive motion capture experiments were conducted to validate the new minimization criterion. Finally, new human performance metrics were introduced to study in details an athletic skill. These metrics include the effort expenditure and the feasible set of operational space accelerations during the performance of the skill. The dynamic characterization takes into account skeletal kinematics as well as muscle routing kinematics and force generating capacities. The developments draw upon an advanced musculoskeletal modeling platform and a task-oriented framework for the effective integration of biomechanics and robotics methods.},

abstract = {The authors examine different methods of solving the force
distribution problem for the limbs of a legged vehicle with friction
cone constraints. A key concept in the proposed formulations is the use
of pseudoinverses to provide a decomposition of the original problem in
a form that is more amenable to optimization. The new formulations can
be described as being either interior- or exterior-based methods.
Geometrically, interior methods start a search in force space with a
force that is inside the friction cone constraints but does not
necessarily meet the required body forces and torques. Exterior methods
start with forces that meet the required body forces and torques but may
be outside the friction cone constraints. It is shown that exterior
methods have the potential for providing better force command continuity
when the solution from the previous control cycle is considered or,
alternatively, these methods can be used to minimize the maximum
friction cone angle over all the legs},

This paper introduces a parallelizable algorithm for the efficient computation of independent contact regions, under the assumption that a user input in the form of initial guess for the grasping points is readily available. The proposed approach works on discretized 3D-objects with any number of contacts and can be used with any of the following models: frictionless point contact, point contact with friction and soft finger contact.

We demonstrate both the power and efficiency of our planner using the problem of hitting a nail with a hammer, which requires the robot to reach a given goal velocity while avoiding obstacles. Our planner is able to solve this problem in less than 100 ms. In contrast, a purely geometric planner is unable to hit the nail at the desired velocity, whereas a standard kinodynamic RRT is multiple orders of magnitude slower.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first randomized approach to kinodynamic planning (also known as trajectory planning or trajectory design). The task is to determine control inputs to drive a robot froman initial configuration and velocity to a goal configuration and velocity while obeying physically based dynamical models and avoiding obstacles in the robot's environment. The authors consider generic systems that express the nonlinear dynamics of a robot in terms of the robot's high-dimensional configuration space. Kinodynamic planning is treated as a motion-planning problem in a higher dimensional state space that has both first-order differential constraints and obstacle- based global constraints. The state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning; however, standard ran- domized path-planning techniques do not directly apply to planning trajectories in the state space. The authors have developed a ran- domized planning approach that is particularly tailored to trajectory planning problems in high-dimensional state spaces. The basis for this approach is the construction of rapidly exploring random trees, which offer benefits that are similar to those obtained by success- ful randomized holonomic planning methods but apply to a much broader class of problems. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given. Experimental results are presented for an implementation that computes trajectories for hovercrafts and satellites in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces of up to 12 dimensions.},

abstract = {This paper introduces effective numerical methods for the planning and fast replanning of safe motions to ensure the safety, balance, and integrity of humanoid robots over the whole motion duration. Our safe methods do not depend on, nor are connected to, any type of modeling or constraints. To plan safe motions, certain constraints have to be satisfied over a continuous interval of time. Classical methods revert to time-grid discretization, which can be risky for the robot. We introduce a hybrid method to plan safe motions, which combines a classical unsafe method with a verification step that checks constraint violation and computes excess by the usage of interval analysis. When the robot meets unexpected situations, it has to replan a new motion, which is often too time consuming. Hence, we introduce a new method to rapidly replan safe motions, i.e., in less than 2 s CPU time. It computes offline feasible subsets in the vicinity of safe motions and finds online a solution in these subsets without actually recomputing the nonlinear constraints. Our methods are validated by the use the HOAP-3 robot, where the motions are run with no balance controller.},

abstract = {Sensorimotor control occurs simultaneously on multiple levels. We present a general approach to designing feedback control hierarchies for redundant biomechanical systems, that approximate the (non-hierarchical) optimal control law but have much lower computational demands. The approach is applied to the task of reaching, using a detailed model of the human arm. Our hierarchy has two levels of feedback control. The high level is designed as an optimal feedback controller operating on a simplified virtual plant. The low level is responsible for transforming the dynamics of the true plant into the desired virtual dynamics. The new method may be useful not only for modelling the neural control of movement, but also for designing functional electric stimulation systems that have to achieve task goals by activating muscles in real time.},

abstract = {This paper formalizes qualitative test of 3D frictional
form-closure grasps of n robotic fingers as a problem of linear
programming (LP). It is well-known that a sufficient and necessary
condition for form-closure grasps is that the origin of the wrench space
lies inside the convex hull of primitive contact wrenches. We
demonstrate that the problem of querying whether the origin lies inside
the convex hull is equivalent to a ray-shooting problem, which is dual
to a LP problem based on the duality between convex hulls and convex
polytopes. Furthermore, this paper addresses a problem of minimizing the
L{\{}{\textless}{\}}sub{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}1{\{}{\textless}{\}}/sub{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} norm of the grasp forces balancing an external wrench,
which can be also transformed to a ray-shooting problem. We have
implemented the algorithms and confirmed their real-time efficiency for
qualitative test and grasp force optimization},

Reduction of the number of variables of the QP formulation. Joint accelerations are completely removed. Torques are reduced to the part in the nullspace of the contact Jacobian J. The contact forces are reduced to the part in the nullspace of (U J{\{}{\^{}}{\}}T).
Comments 
Some passages are not clear, for instance when passing from tau to z in (27).
I liked the idea of limiting the inequality constraints on the contact forces to having enough forces to satisfy the condition on the rank of JU{\{}{\^{}}{\}}T. However I'm not sure that this is done properly in the paper, because it is in the form (40), i.e. f{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}0, which is fine only for normal forces. 
Improvements 
It may be possible to achieve the same reduction without having to decompose the mass matrix.},

abstract = {In this paper, a sample nonlinear contact model is pre- sented for use in computer simulation. The nonlinear model is shown to maintain the computational sim- plicity of the linear model while addressing many of its deficiencies. One such advantage is that contact forces vary continuously over time. A new phase plane solution for the nonlinear model is obtained which re- veals many previously unnoted properties. These in- clude proper variation of the coejjicient of restitution with impact velocity over a wide range of impact ve- locities, independence of model parameters, and lack of tensile (sticking) forces in simple impacts. An example is presented which demonstrates the use of the contact model in simulating the foot-ground interaction during the locomotion cycle of a walking machine},

abstract = {— Most animal and human locomotion behaviors for solving complex tasks involve dynamic motions and rich contact interaction. In fact, complex maneuvers need to con-sider dynamic movement and contact events at the same time. We present a hierarchical trajectory optimization approach for planning dynamic movements with unscheduled contact sequences. We compute whole-body motions that achieve goals that cannot be reached in a kinematic fashion. First, we find a feasible CoM motion according to the centroidal dynamics of the robot. Then, we refine the solution by applying the robot's full-dynamics model, where the feasible CoM trajectory is used as warm-start point. To accomplish the unscheduled contact behavior, we use complementarity constraints to describe the contact model, i.e. environment geometry and non-sliding active contacts. Both optimization phases are posed as Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). Exper-imental trials demonstrate the performance of our planning approach in a set of challenging tasks.},

The current implementation targets problem families that can be transformed, using disciplined convex programming techniques, to convex quadratic programs of modest size. CVXGEN generates simple, flat, library-free code suitable for embedding in real-time applications. The generated code is almost branch free, and so has highly predictable run-time behavior. The combination of regularization (both static and dynamic) and iterative refinement in the search direction computation yields reliable performance, even with poor quality data. In this paper we describe how CVXGEN is implemented, and give some results on the speed and reliability of the automatically generated solvers.},

abstract = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

abstract = {Quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) have a wide range of applications in signal processing and wireless communications. Non-convex QCQPs are NP-hard in general. Existing approaches relax the non-convexity using semi-definite relaxation (SDR) or linearize the non-convex part and solve the resulting convex problem. However, these techniques are seldom successful in even obtaining a feasible solution when the QCQP matrices are indefinite. In this paper, a new feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation (FPP-SCA) algorithm is proposed for non-convex QCQPs. FPP-SCA linearizes the non-convex parts of the problem as conventional SCA does, but adds slack variables to sustain feasibility, and a penalty to ensure slacks are sparingly used. When FPP-SCA is successful in identifying a feasible point of the non-convex QCQP, convergence to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point is thereafter ensured. Simulations show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in obtaining feasible and near-optimal solutions, significantly outperforming existing approaches.},

Recently developed methods formulate the constrains as a linear complementarity problem, allowing a solution to be computed using proven algorithms, but for anyone implementing such a system, several additional considerations must be taken into account.

of the solution. The main objective when integrating the sensor fusion methods in the existing platform, has been to keep the solution as lean and backwards compatible as possible.
The sensor fusion library is primarily supposed to be maintained and developed by engineers. Configuration and daily use of specific filters are supposed to be handled by other people, with a technical background. 

        
In the design phase this means, that daily use such as start/stop and parameter adjustments must be easily accessible, while the underlying algorithms are for developers only.

        
The sensor fusion library is to be used for fusion of various sensors, but the focus of this initial version is fusion of odometry and GPS signals. The method used is Kalman filtering, and the objective is to develop methods
for both the Ackerman steered and differentially steered vehicles.

abstract = {We present a method for training recurrent neural networks to act as near-optimal feedback controllers. It is able to generate stable and realistic behaviors for a range of dynamical systems and tasks – swimming, flying, biped and quadruped walking with different body morphologies. It does not require motion capture or task-specific features or state machines. The controller is a neural network, having a large number of feed-forward units that learn elaborate state-action mappings, and a small number of recurrent units that implement memory states beyond the physical system state. The action generated by the network is defined as velocity. Thus the network is not learning a control policy, but rather the dynamics under an implicit policy. Essential features of the method include interleaving supervised learning with trajectory optimization, injecting noise during training, training for unexpected changes in the task specification, and using the trajectory optimizer to obtain optimal feedback gains in addition to optimal actions. Figure 1: Illustration of the dynamical systems and tasks we have been able to control using the same method and architecture. See the video accompanying the submission.},

abstract = {Dynamically simulated characters are difficult to control because they are underactuated---they have no direct control over their global position and orientation. In order to succeed, control policies must look ahead to determine stabilizing actions, but such planning is complicated by frequent ground contacts that produce a discontinuous search space. This paper introduces a locomotion system that generates high-quality animation of agile movements using nonlinear controllers that plan through such contact changes. We demonstrate the general applicability of this approach by emulating walking and running motions in rigid-body simulations. Then we consolidate these controllers under a higher-level planner that interactively controls the character's direction.},

abstract = {Envisioned applications for humanoid robots require the presence of balancing and walking controllers. Whilepromising results have been achieved recently, robust and reliable controllers are still a challenge for the control community. State-of-the-art balancing controllers are based on the control of the robot momentum, but the stability analysis of these controllers is still missing. The contribution of this paper is twofold. We first numerically show that the application of state-of-the-art momentum-based control strategies may lead to unstable zero dynamics. Secondly, we propose simple modifications to the control architecture that avoid instabilities at the zero-dynamics level. Asymptotic stability of the closed loop system is shown by means of a Lyapunov analysis. The theoretical results are validated with both simulations and experiments on the iCub humanoid robot.},

abstract = {In this work we present a trajectory Optimization framework for whole-body motion planning through contacts. We demonstrate how the proposed approach can be applied to automatically discover different gaits and dynamic motions on a quadruped robot. In contrast to most previous methods, we do not pre-specify contact switches, timings, points or gait patterns, but they are a direct outcome of the optimization. Furthermore, we optimize over the entire dynamics of the robot, which enables the optimizer to fully leverage the capabilities of the robot. To illustrate the spectrum of achievable motions, here we show eight different tasks, which would require very different control structures when solved with state-of-the-art methods. Using our trajectory Optimization approach, we are solving each task with a simple, high level cost function and without any changes in the control structure. Furthermore, we fully integrated our approach with the robot's control and estimation framework such that optimization can be run online. By demonstrating a rough manipulation task with multiple dynamic contact switches, we exemplarily show how optimized trajectories and control inputs can be directly applied to hardware.},

A fast motion pattern generation technique that follows the desired ZMP is adopted. In order to satisfy the control input given online, subsequent motion patterns are updated and connected in a stable manner to the old ones while executing. During the creation of motion trajectories online, the commanded motion parameters are checked and modified automatically considering the performance limitations of the hardware. As an example application, we have implemented a one step cycle control system on the Humanoid H7. Experiments controlling the upper body motion and walking direction using a joystick interface are explained to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Manipulation of structured objects connected to the environment by a kinematics chain involves two problems: (a) The objects have movable directions and unmovable directions. An undesired reaction force in the unmovable directions prevents a robot from successful manipulation; (b) The reaction forces from the objects could fluctuate during manipulation. Related works have enabled robots to manipulate objects by integrating position control in movable directions and force control in unmovable directions at the hands. However, in the case of a humanoid robot, too large undesired reaction forces in movable directions cause the robot's falling down and slipping. In this paper, we propose a controller system controlling reaction forces at the hands and successively updating reference forces based on reaction forces. For problem (a), we apply force control both to the movable and unmovable directions in order to satisfy both maintaining full-body balance and achieving manipulation. For problem (b), the update of the reference forces enables the humanoid robot to adapt to fluctuation of the reaction forces. We show experimental results on the cmanipulating four doors and a drawer.},

abstract = {Quasistatic legged locomotion over uneven terrains requires characterization of the mechanism's feasible equilibrium postures. This paper characterizes the feasible equilibrium postures of mechanisms supported by three frictional point contacts in a three-dimensional gravitational environment, for a subclass of contact arrangements, called tame , for which the friction cones lie above the plane spanned by the contacts. The kinematic structure of the mechanism is lumped into a single rigid body Β having the same contacts with the environment and a variable center of mass. The equilibrium postures associated with a given set of contacts become the center-of-mass locations of Β that maintain a feasible equilibrium with respect to gravity. The paper establishes the relations between the feasible equilibrium region and the classical support polygon principle. For tame 3-contact arrangements, the paper identifies and characterizes geometrically three types of boundary curves of the feasible equilibrium region, where two of them are obtained is closed-from, and the third is given implicitly as a solution of a set of nonlinear equations, which can be traced numerically. The three types of boundary curves are then associated with the onset of three different modes of non-static contact motions. Finally, the paper reports on experimental results that verify the theoretical predictions by using a 3-legged prototype.},

abstract = {Legged vehicles offer several advantages over wheeled vehicles, particularly over broken terrain, but are presently too slow to be advantageous for many tasks. Trotting, the precursor to galloping for many quadrupeds, employs high-speed actuation to coordinate the intermittent ground contacts for each leg. Compliant elements and high-power actuators combine to perform a complex interchange of potential and kinetic energy during these short thrust intervals. These complexities, the frictional and contact losses that occur during normal running, plus the high number of degrees of freedom make three-dimensional (3D) dynamic quadruped motion very difficult to model accurately for control. For this reason, most of the research effort has been focused on simplified planar systems, only allowing motion in the sagittal plane. Many of these controllers only perform well around a fixed operating point and cannot regulate heading for desired changes in running direction. A 3D trotting controller which overcomes the above problems is presented here. Simulation results show the system responding appropriately to changes in the desired speed up to 3 m/s and heading up to 20 deg/s. },

It is shown that an MIMO terminal switching plane variable vector is first defined, and the relationship between the terminal switching plane variable vector and system error dynamics is established. By using the MIMO terminal sliding mode technique and a few structural properties of rigid robotic manipulators, a robust controller can then be designed so that the output tracking error can converge to zero in a finite time, and strong robustness with respect to large uncertain dynamics can be guaranteed. It is also shown that the high gain of the terminal sliding mode controllers can be significantly reduced with respect to the one of the linear sliding mode controller where the sampling interval is nonzero},

There are diverse alternatives for the implementation of direct transcription. In this study we analyze the effects of such alternatives when solving a robotics problem. Different parameters such as integration scheme, number of discretization nodes, initialization strategies and complexity of the problem are evaluated. We measure the performance of the methods in terms of computational time, accuracy and quality of the solution. Additionally, we compare two optimization methodologies frequently used to solve the transcribed problem, namely Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and Interior Point Method (IPM). As a benchmark, we solve different motion tasks on an underactuated and non-minimal-phase ball-balancing robot with a 10 dimensional state space and 3 dimensional input space. Additionally, we validate the results on a simulated 3D quadrotor. Finally, as a verification of using direct transcription methods for trajectory optimization on real robots, we present hardware experiments on a motion task including path constraints and actuation limits.},

abstract = {Autonomous learning is one of the hallmarks of human and animal behavior, and understanding the principles of learning will be crucial in order to achieve true autonomy in advanced machines like humanoid robots. In this paper, we examine learning of complex motor skills with human-like limbs. While supervised learning can offer useful tools for bootstrapping behavior, e.g., by learning from demonstration, it is only reinforcement learning that offers a general approach to the final trial-and-error improvement that is needed by each individual acquiring a skill. Neither neurobiological nor machine learning studies have, so far, offered compelling results on how reinforcement learning can be scaled to the high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces of humans or humanoids. Here, we combine two recent research developments on learning motor control in order to achieve this scaling. First, we interpret the idea of modular motor control by means of motor primitives as a suitable way to generate parameterized control policies for reinforcement learning. Second, we combine motor primitives with the theory of stochastic policy gradient learning, which currently seems to be the only feasible framework for reinforcement learning for humanoids. We evaluate different policy gradient methods with a focus on their applicability to parameterized motor primitives. We compare these algorithms in the context of motor primitive learning, and show that our most modern algorithm, the Episodic Natural Actor-Critic outperforms previous algorithms by at least an order of magnitude. We demonstrate the efficiency of this reinforcement learning method in the application of learning to hit a baseball with an anthropomorphic robot arm.},

abstract = {We propose a method that enables kinodynamic planning in the configuration space (of dimension n) instead of the state space (of dimension 2n), thereby potentially cutting down the complexity of usual kinodynamic planning algorithms by an exponential factor. At the heart of this method is a new technique -- called Velocity Interval Propagation -- which, given a path in the configuration space and an interval of reachable velocities at the beginning of that path, computes exactly and efficiently the interval of all the velocities the system can reach after traversing the path while respecting the system kinodynamic constraints. Combining this technique with usual sampling-based methods gives rise to a family of new motion planners that can appropriately handle kinodynamic constraints while avoiding the complexity explosion and, to some extent, the conceptual difficulties associated with a move to the state space.},

abstract = {Contact constraints, such as those between a foot and the ground or a hand and an object, are inherent in many robotic tasks. These constraints define a manifold of feasible states; while well understood mathematically, they pose numerical challenges to many algorithms for planning and controlling whole-body dynamic motions. In this paper, we present an approach to the synthesis and stabilization of complex trajectories for both fully-actuated and underactuated robots subject to contact constraints. We introduce an extension to the direct collocation trajectory optimization algorithm that naturally incorporates the manifold constraints to produce a nominal trajectory with third-order integration accuracy---a critical feature for achieving reliable tracking control. We adapt the classical time-varying linear quadratic regulator to produce a local cost-to-go in the tangent plane of the manifold. Finally, we descend the cost-to-go using a quadratic program that incorporates unilateral friction and torque constraints. This approach is demonstrated on three complex walking and climbing locomotion examples in simulation.},

abstract = {Many critical tasks in robotics, such as locomotion or manipulation, involve collisions between a rigid body and the environment or between multiple bodies. Sums-of-squares (SOS) based methods for numerical computation of Lyapunov certificates are a powerful tool for analyzing the stability of continuous nonlinear systems, which can play a powerful role in motion planning and control design. Here, we present a method for applying sums-of-squares verification to rigid bodies with Coulomb friction undergoing discontinuous, inelastic impact events. The proposed algorithm explicitly generates Lyapunov certificates for stability, positive invariance, and reachability over admissible (non-penetrating) states and contact forces. We leverage the complementarity formulation of contact, which naturally generates the semialgebraic constraints that define this admissible region. The approach is demonstrated on multiple robotics examples, including simple models of a walking robot and a perching aircraft.},

abstract = {It is known that for a large magnitude push a human or a humanoid robot must take a step to avoid a fall. Despite some scattered results, a principled approach towards "when and where to take a step" has not yet emerged. Towards this goal, we present methods for computing capture points and the capture region, the region on the ground where a humanoid must step to in order to come to a complete stop. The intersection between the capture region and the base of support determines which strategy the robot should adopt to successfully stop in a given situation. Computing the capture region for a humanoid, in general, is very difficult. However, with simple models of walking, computation of the capture region is simplified. We extend the well-known linear inverted pendulum model to include a flywheel body and show how to compute exact solutions of the capture region for this model. Adding rotational inertia enables the humanoid to control its centroidal angular momentum, much like the way human beings do, significantly enlarging the capture region. We present simulations of a simple planar biped that can recover balance after a push by stepping to the capture region and using internal angular momentum. Ongoing work involves applying the solution from the simple model as an approximate solution to more complex simulations of bipedal walking, including a 3D biped with distributed mass.},

abstract = {This paper considers the stability of an object supported by several frictionless contacts in a potential field such as gravity. The bodies supporting the object induce a partition of the object's configuration space into strata corresponding to different contact arrangements. Stance stability becomes a geometric problem of determining whether the object's configuration is a local minimum of its potential energy function on the stratified configuration space. We use stratified Morse theory to develop a generic stance stability test that has the following characteristics. For a small number of contacts - less than three in 2D and less than six in 3D - stance stability depends both on surface normals and surface curvature at the contacts. Moreover, lower curvature at the contacts leads to better stability. For a larger number of contacts, stance stability depends only on surface normals at the contacts. The stance stability test is applied to quasi-static locomotion planning in two dimensions. The region of stable center-of-mass positions associated with a {\{}{\textless}{\}}i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}k{\{}{\textless}{\}}/i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}-contact stance is characterized. Then, a quasi-static locomotion scheme for a three-legged robot over a piecewise linear terrain is described. Finally, friction is shown to provide robustness and enhanced stability for the frictionless locomotion plan. A full maneuver simulation illustrates the locomotion scheme.},

Today, robotics are used in a much wider set of applications, and a key factor is to empower people in their daily lives across work, leisure, and domestic tasks. Three factors drive the adoption of robots: i) improved productivity in the increas- ingly competitive international environment; ii) improved quality of life in the presence of a signifi- cantly aging society; and iii) removing first responders and soldiers from the immediate danger/action. Economic growth, quality of life, and safety of our first responders continue to be key drivers for the adoption of robots. Robotics},

control with manipulators possessing low-level position and/or velocity
controllers typically employed in industrial robot arms. Previously
reported approaches and experimental results are reviewed. A new

arms in contact with surfaces of unknown linear compliance is reported.
The controller provably guarantees global asymptotic convergence of
force trajectory tracking errors to zero when the robot is under exact
or asymptotically exact inner loop velocity control. An additional
result which guarantees arbitrarily small force errors for bounded inner
loop velocity tracking errors is presented. Comparative experiments show
the new adaptive velocity (position) based controller and its
nonadaptive counterpart to provide performance superior to that of
previously reported position-based force controllers},

In particular, a visual system has been used to cope with the problem of unknown objects grasping.

abstract = {This paper addresses the sensitivity analysis for hybrid systems with discontinuous (jumping) state trajectories. We consider state-triggered jumps in the state evolution, potentially accompanied by mode switching in the control vector field as well. For a given trajectory with state jumps, we show how to construct an approximation of a nearby perturbed trajectory corresponding to a small variation of the initial condition and input. A major complication in the construction of such an approximation is that, in general, the jump times corresponding to a nearby perturbed trajectory are not equal to those of the nominal one. The main contribution of this work is the development of a notion of error to clarify in which sense the approximate trajectory is, at each instant of time, a firstorder approximation of the perturbed trajectory. This notion of error naturally finds application in the (local) tracking problem of a time-varying reference trajectory of a hybrid system. To illustrate the possible use of this new error definition in the context of trajectory tracking, we outline how the standard linear trajectory tracking control for nonlinear systems -based on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) theory to compute the optimal feedback gain- could be generalized for hybrid systems.},

Under mild assumptions about the degree of smoothness exhibit by the nonlinear functions, the algorithm is proven to be globally stable, with tracking errors converging to a neighborhood of zero. A constructive procedure is detailed, which directly translates the assumed smoothness properties of the nonlinearities involved into a specification of the network required to represent the plant to a chosen degree of accuracy. A stable weight adjustment mechanism is determined using Lyapunov theory. The network construction and performance of the resulting controller are illustrated through simulations with example systems.},

However, some difficulties remain to be dealt with, particularly about the implementation of fast and dynamic walking gaits, in other words anthropomorphic gaits, especially on uneven terrain. In this perspective, both concepts of center of pressure (CoP) and zero moment point (ZMP) are obviously useful. In this paper, the two concepts are strictly defined, the CoP with respect to ground-feet contact forces, the ZMP with respect to gravity plus inertia forces. Then, the coincidence of CoP and ZMP is proven, and related control aspects are examined. Finally, a virtual CoP-ZMP is defined, allowing us to extend the concept when walking on uneven terrain. This paper is a theoretical study. Experimental results are presented in a companion paper, analyzing the evolution of the ground contact forces obtained from a human walker wearing robot feet as shoes.},

abstract = {Practical difficulties involved in implementing stabilizing model predictive control laws for nonlinear systems are well known. Stabilizing formulations of the method normally rely on the assumption that global and exact solutions of nonconvex, nonlinear optimization problems are possible in limited computational time. In the paper, we first establish conditions under which suboptimal model predictive control (MPC) controllers are stabilizing; the conditions are mild holding out the hope that many existing controllers remain stabilizing even if optimality is lost. Second, we present and analyze two suboptimal MPC schemes that are guaranteed to be stabilizing, provided an initial feasible solution is available and for which the computational requirements are more reasonable},

HyQ stands 1 m tall, weighs roughly 90 kg, and features 12 torque-controlled joints powered by a combination of hydraulic and electric actuators. The hydraulic actuation permits the robot to perform powerful and dynamic motions that are hard to achieve with more traditional electrically actuated robots. This paper describes design and specifications of the robot and presents details on the hardware of the quadruped platform, such as the mechanical design of the four articulated legs and of the torso frame, and the configuration of the hydraulic power system. Results from the first walking experiments are presented, along with test studies using a previously built prototype leg.},

annote = {STATIC BALANCE CONTROL
Put one feet forward so that you get a large support polygon, control horizontal COM back and forth

SQUAT BALANCE
Control 3d COM up and down to make robot squat

WALKING
Walking is created by sequencing four movements: (1) shifting the robot's weight to the right foot, (2) swinging the right foot forward, (3) shifting the weight back to the left foot, and (4) swinging the left foot forward.
Task Feasibility:
When the condition number of the foot grows beyond normal values we command the foot to step back within the reachable workspace to gain stability.

HIT BALL IN MID AIR - FORWARD JUMP
Control feet for landing stability. Move COM vertical position down and then up to jump.

ZMP Control (pg 78)
Acceleration control can be used to control dynamic balance by manipulating the ZMP, the point on the ground where the horizontal moments due to ground reaction forces are equal to zero.

Computing kinematic and dynamic quantities in our control framework is computationally expensive for a realtime controller, with operations ranging from O(n) to O(n{\{}{\^{}}{\}}3) of algorithmic complexity. To handle these computations in realtime, we implement two separate update loops. While feedback controllers are updated at servo rates, around 1KHz, kinematic and dynamic quantities that depend only on joint positions are updated at slow rates, normally around 20Hz to 50Hz. This dual update strategy is currently under test.

Because many humanoid robots are controlled through joint positions and not through torques, Khatib et al. recently developed a torque to position transformer (see Khatib, Thaulaud, and Park 2006). Here, joint positions are calculated through the transformation of torques based on the characterization of servo motor transfer functions.},

The center of mass (COM) dynamics are affected directly through contact force control to achieve stable balance. This idea is used to formulate DBFC considering the full rigid-body dynamics of the robot to produce desired contact forces. To achieve generic force control tasks, a virtual model controller, DBFC-VMC, is presented. Results presented from experiments on a force-controlled humanoid robot and simulation demonstrate the general purpose use of this control.},

abstract = {A common issue in three-dimensional animation is the creation of contacts between a virtual creature and the environment. Contacts allow force exertion, which produces motion. This paper addresses the problem of computing contact configurations allowing to perform motion tasks such as getting up from a sofa, pushing an object or climbing. We propose a two-step method to generate contact configurations suitable for such tasks. The first step is an offline sampling of the reachable workspace of a virtual creature. The second step is a run time request confronting the samples with the current environment. The best contact configurations are then selected according to a heuristic for task efficiency. The heuristic is inspired by the force transmission ratio. Given a contact configuration, it measures the potential force that can be exerted in a given direction. Our method is automatic and does not require examples or motion capture data. It is suitable for real time applications and applies to arbitrary creatures in arbitrary environments. Various scenarios (such as climbing, crawling, getting up, pushing or pulling objects) are used to demonstrate that our method enhances motion autonomy and interactivity in constrained environments.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to answer (i) how the stabilization performance of a biped controller can be evaluated on a certain invariant supporting region, (ii) how the standing stabilizer which performs the best on a given supporting region can be designed, (iii) how the system can be judged if it is stabilizable by the best standing stabilizer without deforming the current supporting region, and (iv) how the supporting region should be deformed if it is judged to be necessary. In order to answer these question, the stable standing region is defined. It gives a criterion to design the best standing stabilizer, to judge if the deformation of the supporting region is necessary to stabilize the system, and to maneuver the stepping motion in accordance with the standing stabilizability condition, which is also defined in the paper. It is found that the best standing stabilizer can be designed by a simple pole-assignment technique. This framework unifies the standing stability and the stepping stability of bipedalism, which have been separately considered in conventional studies. The discussion goes on an approximate planar COM-ZMP model, in which the total mass is concentrated at the center of mass, and the position of ZMP is regarded as the input. Though it is the simplest dynamical model of bipeds, it can conceal differences of body constitutions and represent the macroscopic dynamics. Therefore, this paper contributes to not only the biped robot controller design but also the biomechanical analyses.},

abstract = {This paper presents a trajectory-planning method for multibody systems. Trajectory planning of a multibody system is formulated as a constraint-solving problem on a set of variables expressing the motion of the multibody system over a finite-time interval. Constraints express the dynamics of rigid bodies, kinematic conditions of joints, various range limitations, as well as achievement of tasks, and they can be assigned different priority levels. The prioritized constraint-solving problem is then treated under the framework of lexicographical goal programming, where the local optimality of the problem is characterized in terms of Pareto efficiency condition. Based on this observation, an algorithm that iteratively updates the variables toward a locally optimal solution is derived. The proposed method is evaluated in simulation examples.},
annote = {Good work overall, but:
1) did not deal with contacts and with underactuated systems
2) algorithm converges first on highest priority task, than other tasks, similarly to what a sequence of optimizations would do (contrary to HDDP)
3) comparison with weighted approach seems unfair as they used very-close weights (10, 1, 1)

The key idea is to start by looking for a step direction such that all objectives either improve or stay the same. When such a direction does not exist, look for one such that all the objectives except for the last one improve or stay the same, and so on. This is certainly different from HDDP, where we move first in a direction that improves the first objective (regardless of what it does to the others), then a direction that improves the second objective without affecting the first one, and so on.},

annote = {One of the key developments in robotics has been the adop- tion of probabilistic techniques.

        
In the 1970s, the predominant paradigm in robotics was model-based.

        
This changed radically in the mid- 1980s, when the paradigm shifted towards reactive tech- niques.

        
Since the mid-1990s, robotics has shifted its focused towards techniques that uti- lize imperfect models and that incorporate imperfect sensor data. An important paradigm since the mid-1990s—whose origin can easily be traced back to the 1960s—is that of probabilistic robotics.

        
Particle filters [9, 30, 40] comprise a broad fam- ily of sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for approximate inference in partially observable Markov chains (see [9] for an excellent overview on particle filters and applica- tions). 

        
Particle filters were able to solve two important, previously unsolved problems known as the global local- ization [2] and the kidnapped robot [14] problems, in which a robot has to recover its pose under global uncertainty.
Particle filters:
1.Any probabilistic robot model that can be formulated as a Markov chain
2.They dont require a fixed computation time and accuracy increases with computational resources.Attractive to roboticists who hace hard real time constraints that have to be met using hard to control computer hardware.
3.The estimator need not linearize non linar models as the principle is stochastic

        
Demerits:
1.More dimensions means more particles.so successful applications confine to smaller state spaces.
2.Utilization of structure (eg:Conditional independace,Raoblackwellization) has led to appls in higher dimensonal spaces.

        
Low dimensional spaces:
Particle filters are commonly known as Monte Carlo localization (MCL) [7, 51]. MCL's original development was motivated by the condensation algorithm [19], a particle filter that enjoyed great popu- larity in computer vision applications.
particle filters have been consistently found to outperform alternative tech- niques, including parametric probabilistic techniques such as the Kalman filter and more traditional techniques

        
Generating particles using the motion model alone has been recognized as insufficient under a range of conditions such as  in the kidnapped robot problem[26] or when the sensor accuracy is high.Mixture MCl is necessary which generate some samples based on the measurement model that increases robustness in the MCL.

        

        
SLAM-Higher dimensional spaces
Challenges:
1.serious Data Association problem
2.Space of all maps often compromise hundreds of thousand of dimensions and in the beginning of mapping the size of the state space  us usually unknown,so slam algs have to estimate the dimensionality also
 SLAMS using EKF:
 1.Complexity of each update is in the order of N{\^{}}2 and cannot manage more than 1000 features in real time.
2.Cannot handle negative infromation like feature not detected when it is expecting ,EKF cant handle non gaussian posterior.If a sensor failure occurs there is no robustness
3.No sound solution to data associaton

abstract = {This paper presents numerical methods for computing regions of finite-time invariance (funnels) around solutions of polynomial differential equations. First, we present a method which exactly certifies sufficient conditions for invariance despite relying on approximate trajectories from numerical integration. Our second method relaxes the constraints of the first by sampling in time. In applications, this can recover almost identical funnels but is much faster to compute. In both cases, funnels are verified using Sum-of-Squares programming to search over a family of time-varying polynomial Lyapunov functions. Initial candidate Lyapunov functions are constructed using the linearization about the trajectory, and associated time-varying Lyapunov and Riccati differential equations. The methods are compared on stabilized trajectories of a six-state model of a satellite.},

abstract = {A central problem in motor control is understanding how the many biomechanical degrees of freedom are coordinated to achieve a common goal. An especially puzzling aspect of coordination is that behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Existing theoretical frameworks emphasize either goal achievement or the richness of motor variability, but fail to reconcile the two. Here we propose an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal feedback control. We show that the optimal strategy in the face of uncertainty is to allow variability in redundant (task-irrelevant) dimensions. This strategy does not enforce a desired trajectory, but uses feedback more intelligently, correcting only those deviations that interfere with task goals. From this framework, task-constrained variability, goal-directed corrections, motor synergies, controlled parameters, simplifying rules and discrete coordination modes emerge naturally. We present experimental results from a range of motor tasks to support this theory.},

abstract = {Identification results dramatically depend on the excitation properties of the motion used to sample the identification model. Strategies to define persistent exciting trajectories have been developed for manipulator robots with few DOF. However they can not easily be extended to humanoid systems and humans due to the important number of DOF; and empirical knowledge is often used to generate and select persistent exciting motions. In this paper we propose a method to choose persistent exciting motions from an existing dataset in order to optimize both the identification results and the computation time. This method is based on the use of the identification model of legged systems obtained from the base-link equations. Instead of using well-established consideration on the condition number of the regressor matrix, the method uses a decomposition of the regressor into elementary sub-regressors and the computation of the condition number for each. A selection rule is then proposed. The overall method is experimentally tested to identify the human body inertial parameters using a data-set of 40 motions. Comparative results obtained from different combinations of motions are given.},

abstract = {In recent years, many works have appeared which present novel mechanical designs, control strategies or trajectory planning algorithms for improved energy efficiency. The actuator model is an essential part of these works, since the optimization of energy consumption strongly depends of the accuracy of this model. Nevertheless, various authors follow very different approaches, often neglecting speed- and load-dependent losses and inertias of components such as the motor and the gearbox. Furthermore, there is no consensus on how negative power affects power consumption. Some authors calculate energy consumption by integrating the electrical power entirely, by integrating its absolute value, or by integrating only positive power. This paper assesses how well commonly used models succeed in predicting the energy consumption of an 80 W geared DC motor performing a dynamic task, by comparing the results they produce to experimental baseline measurements.},

We demonstrate optimized controllers for walking with different speeds, variation in body shape, and in ground slope.},

abstract = {A humanoid walking robot is a highly nonlinear dynamical system that relies strongly on contact forces between its feet and the ground in order to realize stable motions, but these contact forces are unfortunately severely limited. Model predictive control, also known as receding horizon control, is a general control scheme specifically designed to deal with such constrained dynamical systems, with the potential ability to react efficiently to a wide range of situations. Apart from the question of computation time which needs to be taken care of carefully (these schemes can be highly computation intensive), the initial question of which optimal control problems should be considered to be solved online in order to lead to the desired walking movements is still unanswered. A key idea for answering to this problem can be found in the ZMP preview control scheme. After presenting here this scheme with a point of view slightly different from the original one, we focus on the problem of compensating strong perturbations of the dynamics of the robot and propose a new linear model predictive control scheme which is an improvement of the original ZMP preview control scheme.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel inverse Dynamic Reachability Map (iDRM) that allows a floating base system to find valid end-poses in complex and dynamically changing environments in real-time. End-pose planning for valid stance pose and collision-free configuration is an essential problem for humanoid applications, such as providing goal states for walking and motion planners. However, this is non-trivial in complex environments, where standing locations and reaching postures are restricted by obstacles. Our proposed iDRM customizes the robot-to-workspace occupation list and uses an online update algorithm to enable efficient reconstruction of the reachability map to guarantee that the selected end-poses are always collision-free. The iDRM was evaluated in a variety of reaching tasks using the 38 degree-of-freedom (DoF) humanoid robot Valkyrie. Our results show that the approach is capable of finding valid end-poses in a fraction of a second. Significantly, we also demonstrate that motion planning algorithms integrating our end-pose planning method are more efficient than those not utilizing this technique.},

We propose a method that allows us to apply existing sampling--based algorithms to plan trajectories for humanoids by utilizing a customized state space representation, biased sampling strategies, and a steering function based on a robust inverse kinematics solver. Our approach requires no prior offline computation, thus one can easily transfer the work to new robot platforms. We tested the proposed method solving practical reaching tasks on a 38 degrees--of--freedom humanoid robot, NASA Valkyrie, showing that our method is able to generate valid motion plans that can be executed on advanced full--size humanoid robots. We also present a benchmark between different motion planning algorithms evaluated on a variety of reaching motion problems. This allows us to find suitable algorithms for solving humanoid motion planning problems, and to identify the limitations of these algorithms.},

abstract = {We address practical issues to develop reactive motion planning method capable of replanning the path online when the environment changes during the execution. By introducing planning and execution threads running in parallel, the robot can keep moving even during the replanning process as long as the motion is safe. The proposed method can be applied to discontinuous input of environmental changes that may occur due to incomplete perception. We then address a roadmap reuse method for efficient replanning to make use of the increasing knowledge about the environment, by introducing working and learning roadmaps. A general interface with robot motion controller is also defined so that the method can be applied to various types of robots. The proposed method is validated through planning simulations with moving obstacles.},

abstract = {In this paper we address a task-driven motion generation method that allows a humanoid robot to make whole-body motions including support polygon reshaping to achieve the given tasks. In the proposed method, generalized inverse kinematics (IK) is employed with floating-base to generate humanoid whole-body motions that enable the robot to accomplish the tasks according to given priorities. During the motion, several criteria such as manipulability or end-effector position error are tracked. If the desired task cannot be done because of those criteria, a geometric planner for support polygon is activated. Then the whole-body motion is computed again always using the generalized IK solver including stepping motion that realizes the deformed support polygon by using dynamic walking pattern generator. This method provides a way to perform tasks that could not be done without changing the humanoid's support state. We have verified the proposed framework through simulations and experiments using humanoid robot HRP-2},

abstract = {This paper presents a new control architecture for compliant motion control and safe physical interaction between humanoid robot and human. One of the key technologies in this framework is the torque transformer, which enables the implementation of joint torque control on the traditional joint position controlled robots. In this framework, the torque control is accomplished by converting desired joint torque command into instantaneous increments of joint velocity command. Through the transformer, the Operational Space Formulation was applied to account for the dynamics of the system on the current joint position controlled robots. This approach was experimentally implemented on the physical humanoid robot, HONDA ASIMO's upper body control. The ZMP based stable balance controller of ASIMO was integrated to control the lower body of the robot. In this framework, dynamics control by the torque transformer and stable position based balance controller were connected and coordinated together on the current position controlled humanoid robot. The paper presents modeling process of the torque transformer, whole body controller and the results of the implementation which demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.},

abstract = {High-speed applications impose a hard real-time constraint on the solution of a model predictive control (MPC) problem, which generally prevents the computation of the optimal control input. As a result, in most MPC implementations guarantees on feasibility and stability are sacrificed in order to achieve a real-time setting. In this paper we develop a real-time MPC approach for linear systems that provides these guarantees for arbitrary time constraints, allowing one to trade off computation time vs. performance. Stability is guaranteed by means of a constraint, enforcing that the resulting suboptimal MPC cost is a Lyapunov function. The key is then to guarantee feasibility in real-time, which is achieved by the proposed algorithm through a warm-starting technique in combination with robust MPC design. We address both regulation and tracking of piecewise constant references. As a main contribution of this paper, a new warm-start procedure together with a Lyapunov function for real-time tracking is presented. In addition to providing strong theoretical guarantees, the proposed method can be implemented at high sampling rates. Simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the real-time scheme and show that computation times in the millisecond range can be achieved. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
