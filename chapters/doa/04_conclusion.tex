\label{doa:conclusion}
This chapter presented the technologies that have been developed in the FiaD project to augment collaborative robot manipulators with dynamic obstacle avoidance. All these technologies: a proximity-sensing robot skin, a reactive path planning solution and a robot motion control strategy, have been validated in laboratory prototypes. Also, a preliminary prototype of an integrated solution based on these technologies has been tested in simulation. Effort on making the collision avoidance component generic enough to handle all the skin sensors by feeding only the minimal activated skin cells.
