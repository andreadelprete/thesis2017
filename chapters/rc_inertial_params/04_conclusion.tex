\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
This chapter presented a novel optimization-based inverse-dynamics controller that can balance a legged robot despite bounded uncertainties in its inertial parameters. The controller is based on the state-or-the-art control framework Task-Space Inverse Dynamics. In particular, this work is based on the capture-point inequalities~\cite{Ramos2014a}, which can be included in the controller formulation to ensure the balance of the robot on a level ground. We extended these capture-point inequalities to be robust to bounded uncertainties in the inertial parameters of the robot. The resulting optimization problem is still a Quadratic Program with the same number of variables and inequalities. Moreover, the time required for the additional computation of the robust controller is negligible in this context (i.e. a few microseconds).

We tested the robust controller in simulations with the HRP-2 robot, trying to reach a target position with its right end-effector while balancing. We performed several batches of 100 simulations each, introducing different errors in the inertial parameters and varying the position of the target position and the required speed of motion. Comparisons against a classic TSID controller have shown impressive improvements in terms of fall prevention.
