\chapter{Robustness to Inertial Parameter Errors for Legged Robots Balancing on Level Ground}
\label{chapter:rc}
% \section{Abstract}
% Model-based control  has become more and more popular in the legged robots community in the last ten years. 
% The key idea is to exploit a model of the system to compute precise motor commands that result in the desired motion.
% This allows to improve the quality of the motion tracking, while using lower gains, leading so to higher compliance.
% However, the main flaw of this approach is typically its lack of robustness to modeling errors.
% In this paper we focus on the robustness of inverse-dynamics control to errors in the inertial parameters of the robot.
% We assume these parameters to be known, but only with a certain accuracy.
% We then propose a computationally-efficient optimization-based controller that ensures the balance of the robot despite these uncertainties.
% We used the proposed controller in simulation to perform different reaching tasks with the HRP-2 humanoid robot, in the presence of various modeling errors.
% Comparisons against a standard inverse-dynamics controller through hundreds of simulations show the superiority of the proposed controller in ensuring the robot balance.
