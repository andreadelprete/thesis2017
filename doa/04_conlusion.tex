\section{CONCLUSION}
The paper proposed a creative method to execute a trajectory robust to run-time inequality constraints without compromising on the final goal of a scenario. The method uses 'Stack of Tasks', a jacobian control framework employing the state of the art HQP solver for both equality and inequality constraints. The creativity lies on the way the hierarchical nature of the solver and flexible task definition of the framework is exploited to combine an intuitive main goal definition and reactive trajectory execution to realize a scenario successfully robustly. Experiments were done to verify the validity of the method on a PR2 robot with a skin sensor(in simulation) mounted on its forearm. Future work will focus on generalizing the method for various kind of tasks and extending the framework to systematically design tasks to be added in the controller stack specific to possible desired scenarios. The methodology has a significant potential to 
be used for a robot setup with full body skin sensors.
