\section{Abstract}

Current collaborative robot arms allow more flexible work cells, where they safely collaborate with human operators augmenting productivity in tasks difficult for traditional automation. However, current solutions for safe interactions imply stopping the robot motion when a collision is detected. This reduces the productivity in an operational setup in which unintended, safe collisions can happen often. Active contact evasion by the robot arm is desirable so that the production process continues despite regular interferences and path obstructions. In the Factory-in-a-day project dynamic collision avoidance technologies have been developed, including a proximity-sensing robot skin, a motion control framework based on proximity-sensing and a reactive path-planning solution. This technologies have been integrated into a dynamic-obstacle avoidance framework successfully tested in simulation and
laboratory set-ups. This section presents the obstacle avoidance solution that is currently being implemented with this framework for a collaborative pick and place application prototype. 

Path planning and motion control are usually formalized as separate problems in robotics though both the problems fundamentally solves what a robot should do next. High dimensional configuration spaces, changing environment and uncertainties does not allow to plan real time motion ahead of time requiring a controller to execute the planned trajectory. The fundamental inability to unify both these problems has led to handle the planned trajectory amidst perturbations and unforeseen obstacles using various trajectory execution and deformation mechanisms. The burden in designing an appropriate architecture to handle the information flow between the control and planning components is to be considered as well. This paper is purely an application of the state of the art Hierarchical quadratic programming solver and explores on a creative way to combine motion planning and reactive control. 
%The method is experimentally illustrated using a simple trajectory execution scenario on a PR2 robot with a skin sensor mounted on its forearm.
